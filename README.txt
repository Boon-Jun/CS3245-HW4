Indexing Algorithm:
--------------------

Indexing is done in- memory first and then written into the file at the very end.
The postings are stored in a dictionary with the terms are the keys and a list of postings is the value to each term.
The dictionary of terms is stored in a dicitonary with the terms as the keys and the
tuple of (byte_offset, document_frequency) as the values.

The documents are indexed as follows:

1) Document Ids in the directory are are parsed to integers and sorted

2) Preprocess the text in each document.
	i) Prepare the text by replacing '\n' characters in text with ' '
	ii) Apply the NLTK sentence tokenizer
	iii) Replace all non alphanumeric characters in sentence with space. This step ensures that
	the terms in the sentences are normalized. This has to be done as the word tokenizer fails
	to remove unnecessary symbols from words frequently leading to reduced term frequency
	of a word.
	iv) Word Tokenize each sentece with NLTK sentence tokenizer
	v) Case fold each token
	vi) Apply the NLTK Porter Stemmer

3a) For each term, if the term is new, add the term to the dictionary and the postings.
Then add the occuring Document Id (if it has not already been added) and Term frequency
 into the corresponding postings list in the postings and update the document frequency
in the dictionary.

3b) Keep track of the term frequency of every term in the document with a python dictionary.
Update the term  frequencies as a term is encountered, creating new keys in the dictionary as newer
terms are encountered.

3c) Using the term frequencies, compute the tf values for every term and then compute the document
vector lengths which will be used for computing document scores in the Vector Space Model.
Vector lengths we calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the tf values
for a document. Vector lengths are stored in a python dicitonary with the keys being the document ids.

3) Then, add approximately sqrt(document_frequency) evenly spaced skip pointers
to every postings list in the postings, in the form of a list index to a document_id to its right,
accompanying the select Document Ids. Document Ids with skip pointers will be tuples
of the form: (document_id, term_frequency,  skip_index). This way, an entire posting list can be loaded as a python list
when searching and skips will be performed by accessing the element in the list at the specified skip index.


4) Write the list of all sorted Document Ids to the top of the postings file. This will be used
for NOT queries.

5) While writing the postings list for each term in the postings file, fill the byte_offset value of
where it is written in the file from the start, in each corresponding term in the dictionary. This
makes finding the postings list to be loaded into the memory more efficient, during the search.

6) Pickle the dictionary and write the it to the dictionary file. The entire dictionary can
be unpickled in the memory during the search as it is relatively small compared to the postings,
which will only be loaded list by list for every search query.

7) Pickle the vector lengths dicitonary and write it to the lengths file. The dicitonary
can be unpickled during the search when the document score computation takes place.


Searching Algorithm:
---------------------
In the main implementation of the Search Algorithm, we will be ranking the documents
by lnc.ltc ranking scheme(similar to that of HW3). However, as an addition, we will
also be ranking a document higher if a phrase within the original query exists
within a document. The longer the phrase, the higher the document will rank.
Ranking of the documents by phrase will take precedence of lnc.ltc

We will also document both the MAF2(Mean Average F2) and MAP(Mean Average Precision)
metric here to talk about the performance of our search engine
 as we explain the high level algorithm that we have implemented

====================Ranking by lnc.ltc ranking scheme================
The documents will be ranked according to the lnc.ltc ranking scheme.
That is to say that the weights of each term in the document will be calculated as :
(1 + log10(term_frequency_in_documents))
whereas the weights of each term in the query will be calculated as:
tf-idf = (1 + log(term_frequency_in_query)) * log(number_of_documents/document_frequency)

After that, cosine normalization will be applied to the weights of each term in both
the query and the document, and the dot product of the weights of the terms in the
query and the weights of the terms in the documents will give us a score.

However, in our actual implementation, we omit the step of computing the cosine
normalization for the query since the computation of the cosine normalization
for the query will reduce the calculated scores by the same factor, and the
actual ranking of the documents will not be affected.

===============Parsing of Boolean to FreeText Queries==================
From our experimentation with different techniques, we found that treating boolean
queries as FreeText query provides better results in most cases.
To convert a Boolean query to a FreeText query, we simply concatenate all the terms
with a space in between to create a FreeText.

===============Execution of FreeText Queries====================
Since all types of queries are now considered as FreeText, we can execute all of
them in the same manner. The High level algorithm is as follows

1. First we find all documents with that contains partial phrases up to a size of 4
   (We limit the size of phrases here due to the possiblity of long queries which can greatly increase query time)
	 1.1 With the list of documents that have partial phrases up to a size of 4, we will
	 		 then rank only these documents via the lnc.ltc ranking scheme

	 1.2 Any documents returned will be appended to a relevant documents list by the
	     lnc.ltc ranking scheme

2. Next we find all documents with that contains partial phrases up to a size of 3
		2.1 With the list of documents that have partial phrases up to a size of 3, we will
		    then rank only these documents via the lnc.ltc ranking scheme
    2.2 Any documents returned will be appended to a relevant documents list by the
		    lnc.ltc ranking scheme. Since the documents are appended to the list, the
				order of documents already within the list will not be affected

3. Repeat the whole process for partial phrases of the size of 2 and 1

=============Baseline================
VSM Model, ranking done with what was described in the previous section. The following
are our performance from the 3 given queries

MAF2: 0.3031148884
MAP: 0.2182651002

=============== Query Expansion with Princeton's Wordnet ==============
When experimenting with Query Expansion of the Princetonâ€™s wordnet.
We started with the generation of synonymous terms without considerations of the context
of the query, and the following are the performance measures of such an implementation.

MAF2:  0.1829879703
MAP: 0.1253270719

This implementation performs worser than our Baseline and the reason for this is that
the generation of synonyms without context results in a lot of synonyms that are actually
unrelated to the query.

Next, we decide to implement query expansion with Lesk Algorithm(NLTK). Using our whole query
as the context, we then pass both a term and the context into the algorithm to generate
a set of synonyms. Because of the extra context, the set of generated synonyms are now
much more relevant to the query, and the following are the performance measure for
this specific implementation.

MAF2: 0.2872533973
MAP: 0.1844737291

While the performance measure still seem to indicate that this algorithm is performing
slightly worser than our Baseline, this implementation is still able to perform
reasonably well within the competition framework. Also, our performance measures
is only estimated according to the 3 relevance judgements given to us, and hence,
it is hard to conclude whether this implementation is better/worse than our Baseline.

============== Post processing of generated terms from Query Expansion ==================
To process the generated terms after query expansion, one of the approach is to
execute the search on the different generated terms directly after query expansion.
For example if a term "A" expands into "B", "C" and "D", queries "A L", "B L", "C L"
and "D L" will be executed separately.

However, the previous approach could result in a query that takes a long time to process,
especially if each term in a query can be expanded into many terms, resulting in
many possible combinations of the query

Therefore, our approach after generating to this is to merge the postings list of terms
'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D' together before performing the query.

However the latter approach itself also has some issues and that is after merging the terms
together into one postings list, we will no longer be able to differentiate the document_frequencies
for each term individually since the new postings-list is a postings-list not for a single term,
but for multiple terms.

Summing up all the document-frequencies of each term and treating the sum as the "document-frequnecy"
of the new posting list is also problematic as it would affect the overall ranking of the documents
by changing the IDF weighting. To account for this problem we decided to take the average document-frequency
to generate a new "document-frequency" for this new posting list and it seems like this approach is able
to work moderately well within the competition framework.

=============== Language Model(Mixture Model) ==============
We also tried implementing a probabilistic model for our search engine, building upon the
Mixture mod
More specifically, we implemented the mixture model as discussed within the lecture notes.
However, it seems like the VSM approach is able to perform slightly better than the mixture model.
Therefore, we chose to discard this approach.
